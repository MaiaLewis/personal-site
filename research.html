              Two and half years into working on Quill, our
              data-to-natural-language platform, we realized that we did not
              have a clear understanding of our target customer. There were two
              pilots in progress, one with a US Intelligence contractor, called
              IQT Labs, and another with consulting giant, Deloitte. We also had
              hopes of moving our existing customer base, mostly financial
              institutions, from the old platform to the new. The spread of use
              cases was wide, sharing little in the form of data structure,
              language requirements, and most significantly, user personas. We
              knew we needed more focus.
            </p>
            <p>
              The full product and design team embarked on an 8 week research
              effort, with the charge of developing a perspective on who our
              target customer should be, so that we could design the platform to
              suit their needs. We interviewed people across 15 different
              companies, in order to understand how their organizations used
              data and where we could create value.

            <p>These slides record the output of our research.</p>
