              If the sales summary above sounds a bit odd, that’s because it was
              written by an early version of Quill3, the Natural Language
              Generation (NLG) platform I worked on during my three years at
              Narrative Science. In 2016, a team of twelve engineers and two
              designers—myself included—were on a quest to programmatically
              represent the endless flexibility of language in a useful and
              meaningful way. A few additional rules like “don’t start a
              sentence with a number” and “don’t use a pronoun when defining a
              group” would improve the coherence of the sentences above, but in
              late 2016, we were thrilled to say our platform could write this
              summary with only a small amount of configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
              The business Narrative Science was founded in 2010 by two
              Northwestern University Computer Science professors and their
              business partners. A handful of graduate students had created a
              program that could generate short recap stories about little
              league baseball games, given data such as player names and scores.
            </p>
            <p>
              The business opportunity became clear—every day we generate more
              and more data that requires manpower to be analyzed and shared in
              a meaningful way. The game summarizer served as a prototype for
              the company’s first platform, Quill, which could be configured to
              construct sentences and paragraphs based on structured data.
            </p>
            <p>
              As of November 2021, Narrative Science has been acquired by
              Salesforce and joined the ranks of startup success stories.
              However, when I joined in early 2015, the company was about 70
              people strong and growing quickly. The majority of business came
              from financial institutions wanting to automate their portfolio
              commentary. In a traditional set up, financial advisors spend a
              significant amount of time writing summaries of each client’s
              portfolio performance, to be shared alongside graphs and charts on
              a quarterly basis. The writing required is straightforward, based
              entirely on data, and very routine. With Quill, they could
              generate summaries in seconds that were accurate and
              indistinguishable from the human-crafted alternative. The premise
              of the new platform I was hired to support the engineering team as
              they embarked on creating the third version of the software.
              Quill, like many early platforms, was designed almost entirely by
              engineers. While it supported an impressive spread of clients and
              their use cases, it was extremely complicated to configure and
              required an internal professional services team to run and
              maintain each project. The goal of the ambitious redesign was
              twofold: one, to make the platform self-service with a simple and
              intuitive user experience, and two, to transform the underlying
              representation from a rules engine of text snippets and data
              transformations into an intelligent combination of three separate
              things: the language knowledge specific to a domain, the author’s
              communication goals arranged into an outline, and the data
              requirements that would map it to the source file or database. The
              early user interface The Quill 3 experience we designed had four
              primary screens within the context of a project: the outline, the
              ontology, the data requirements, and the live story. Within the
              outline, the project author would arrange communication goals. The
              goals were generalized, analytical statements, such as “Present
              the attribute of an entity,” and “Compare the attribute of entity
              1 to entity 2.” The author would then configure these goals with
              the specifics of the story—pulling language from the project
              ontology—into statements like “Present the grade of the student in
              2015.” The ontology stored the language settings specific to the
              project. The author could create entities, such as a “student” and
              “class”, relationships, such as “is enrolled in,” and attributes
              like “name” and “ID”. These language settings included multiple
              expressions, for example “high schooler” might be an alternative
              to “student.” The ontology could be saved and shared to other
              projects. We aspired to have language models for any imaginable
              domain that an author could pull into their project from a global
              knowledge base. Within the data requirements, the author would map
              the entities and attributes referenced in their outline to fields
              from a data source. So for example, the names of students might be
              found in a field called “full_name” from a table called
              “student_info”, while their grade might be pulled from the field
              “final” in a table called “BIO201_2015”. Finally, the live story
              page would show the generated story. The author could preview
              different versions by flipping the data source or a high level
              filter. They also had the ability to edit expressions, and resolve
              errors in line. At a high level, the user interface borrowed from
              other creative tools, where the body of the page reflected the
              state of the project, and configuration and settings were handled
              in a set of dynamic menus along the right. We designed many of
              these sidebars to be accessible from multiple screens, for
              example, the menu for editing an expression could be triggered
              from either the ontology or the live story. While there were many
              screens to navigate, most new users quickly understood the concept
              of the outline, how it influenced the data requirements, and what
              to expect from the live story page. The UI was successful in many
              ways, and for a first-of-its-kind tool, had a relatively shallow
              learning curve. Experiments in code A year or so into working
              primarily with engineers, I was feeling both inspired by my
              colleagues and limited in my ability to express new design ideas.
              I started tinkering in code. I learned the basics of Python from a
              book, the nuts and bolts of running code in a development
              environment from anyone who had time, and the fundamentals of
              javascript and front-end frameworks from my ever patient manager,
              Andrew Paley. At the time, two aspects of the platform were in
              dire need of usability improvement. First, language configuration
              was quite complex. The author had to recall a significant amount
              of grade-school grammar in order to understand how to use Quill’s
              expression settings. I wanted the platform to leverage NLP
              (Natural Language Processing) as a way to automatically extract
              the language preferences, so that the author wasn’t required to
              provide things like past participles and prepositions. The second,
              more complex, challenge was both a usability and core
              functionality shortcoming. Quill’s underlying model was designed
              so that an attribute could only be filtered by the entity it was
              associated with, and a timeframe. Sometimes, that was all that was
              necessary. For example, if the author wanted to write about the
              height of different basketball players. Often, however, we ran
              into challenges expressing values that had multiple filterable
              dimensions. For example, if the author wanted to express the
              number of points scored by a certain player from behind the
              three-point line. In that scenario, Quill would be unable to
              appropriately express the attribute (points) because it was
              associated with both a player and a distance from the basket. I
              wanted to see Quill support more complex filtering functionality,
              and use a graph to visualize the language model. With my nascent
              skills, I started exploring solutions to these design challenges.
              My first ever working prototype allowed an author to “teach” Quill
              by writing short phrases in natural language, as if they were
              explaining their domain to someone totally unfamiliar. The second
              prototype used graphs to visualize mulit-dimension relationships.
              The author would create a relationship of entities in a graph, and
              select the appropriate language to express their relationship
              correctly. They could then select preconfigured analysis
              statements in the write tab to build their story. Interact with
              the prototype here (it will definitely break) While these concepts
              never made it into production, they inspired several first-place
              hackathon projects, and influenced the collective mindshare of the
              team. Three years of learning I learned more each day that I
              worked at Narrative Science than during any other period in my
              career. What I learned at Narrative Science could fill a library,
              but I have condensed the major takeaways into the following three
              themes. First, no matter how revolutionary the technology is, a
              product must be designed for real people with a real use case. Our
              reluctance to narrow our focus to a target customer and define our
              product against their needs and motivations made it exceedingly
              challenging to agree on our priorities. This eventually led to a
              fairly dramatic product and leadership pivot. Second, when
              designing new technology, it’s incredibly important for teams to
              focus their creative energy on the unsolved problems. Many of the
              experiences we designed in Quill 3 had existing solutions, and the
              time we spent reinventing them was time we didn’t spend focusing
              on the problems that were truly unique to our product. And
              finally, great teamwork has magical properties—five people with
              the right match of skills and team dynamics can accomplish what 50
              people can in the same amount of time. I am so thankful for the
              exceptional people I had the opportunity to collaborate with on
              Quill 3, but especially the other two members of the Design trio,
              Andrew Paley and Sharon Chen.
