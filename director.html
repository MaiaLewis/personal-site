              I feel fortunate to have had the chance to manage a team, and even
              more grateful to return to the work I love as an individual
              contributor. Several years later, I can now reflect on my time in
              management with greater clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The opportunity to manage the design and research team at
              ShopRunner came somewhat unexpectedly. I had just returned from
              maternity leave to find my organization had largely turned over
              while I was away, and was in need of management. To be honest, I
              was sleep-deprived and already overwhelmed with my new
              responsibilities as a parent. While I might not have felt ready at
              the time, I’m incredibly thankful for the chance to grow into the
              role with such a supportive and talented team.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are approximately a million things to learn in your first
              year of management. Two books that helped me find my way are
              <a href="#" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"
                >The Making of a Manager</a
              >
              and
              <a href="#" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"
                >Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop
                Talking</a
              >. I would recommend them to anyone, but especially those who
              don’t think of themselves as the management type.
            </p>
            <p>
              With much reflection, below are my raw strengths, struggles, and
              learnings.
            </p>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-12">Things I excelled at</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-8 space-y-2">
              <li>
                I’ve always loved and continue to love thinking strategically
                and communicating a vision. I was in my element whenever the
                need arose to distill multiple perspectives, chart out clear
                options, or put creative energy into imagining the future. With
                a team under me, people looked to me for that kind of input,
                something I had long been pining for.
              </li>
              <li>
                I hired some exceptional people. Especially in the beginning, I
                deeply enjoyed hiring people I knew would grow quickly. I pride
                myself in my ability to seek out and foster growth mindset.
              </li>
              <li>
                I let people make their own decisions. I organized product
                designers as the owners of their own products and expected them
                to manage their team relationships and decisions with authority.
              </li>
              <li>
                I loved to mentor and teach. If someone wanted to learn, I would
                create all but a class syllabus on the topic, with every
                resource I had found helpful in the past.
              </li>
              <li>
                I created an inclusive, respectful culture. I have no tolerance
                for negativity and discouraging feedback. I did my best to
                demonstrate an open minded and experimental approach to design.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-12">Things I struggled with</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-8 space-y-2">
              <li>
                I struggled to build cross-functional partnerships but later
                recognized the value of dedicating time to relationship-building
                across teams.
              </li>
              <li>
                I underestimated the support needs of my junior designers,
                realizing that I needed to adapt my mentorship style for
                different experience levels.
              </li>
              <li>
                I found it difficult to create an environment where disagreement
                led to productive outcomes, something I would prioritize and
                approach differently in the future.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-12">
              Things I would do differently next time
            </h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-8 space-y-2">
              <li>
                First of all, I will be more discerning in my next management
                role. I found management very demanding of my energy, in a way I
                wouldn’t take on again without exceptional circumstances. At the
                time, it felt like the only path forward, but having scratched
                the itch, I now feel very comfortable wielding influence as an
                individual contributor.
              </li>
              <li>
                Schedule time for building relationships and prepare for them.
                This is true for both management and IC roles, but did not come
                intuitively to me, as a profound introvert. Relationships take
                time and effort to build, and have to be prioritized against
                other kinds of work.
              </li>
              <li>
                I would use frameworks to manage productive disagreement. I
                found conflict between my direct reports paralyzingly
                uncomfortable. However, diverse opinions are critical to problem
                solving. I would lean more on methods as simple as pro-con
                lists, decision logs, and pre-mortems to create constructive
                discourse.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              So what does it take to manage a design team? Simply put,
              practice. Management is a skill developed over time, just like any
              other. Whether you're intimidated or excited by the idea, know
              that it’s a journey of continuous learning. And if management
              isn't the right path for you, remember that influence can be
              wielded from any role, without a formal title.
