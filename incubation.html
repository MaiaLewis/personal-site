              Consider a database of shopping transactions. Within the millions
              of hypothetical rows, a near-infinite amount of information can be
              queried. You might simply want to know what dollar amount is
              associated with a specific transaction ID, or perhaps you just
              need the billing address. Slightly more complex, you could want to
              know how many purchases a particular person made in May of last
              year. Or the average amount associated with transactions made by
              customers in Chicago, or by Amex cards, or in purchases that
              included a white sweater.

              In a typical organization, the curious party would submit a
              request with an analyst, who would then—most likely days
              later—write a SQL query, and return some amount of data that would
              hopefully answer the question. But what if, instead of needing
              someone to translate your curiosity into code, you could ask the
              database directly? What if you could simply ask a question in
              Slack and get an immediate answer. How would that change how we
              use data? How would that impact decision making?

              These were the questions that inspired our incubation project
              concept. During my time at Narrative Science, the leadership team
              initiated a quarterly rotating incubation team, where anyone
              interested in participating could pitch an idea and, if chosen,
              have 3 months (part-time) to create a prototype with the support
              of a four person team. My pitch partner Clayton Norris and I were
              given the inaugural project.

              At the end of the 3 months we presented a live demo, using a real
              data set from a prospective partner, the existing NLG platform,
              and a few new pieces of entity recognition functionality.

              This question demonstrates that Quill 3 can be taught
              superlatives, and know which data type corresponds with that
              superlative. In this case "best selling" is associated with the
              attribute "sales" and points to a field in the data called
              "amount".
            </p>

            <p>
              In the above question, the platform tracked the most salient
              entity in the conversation, identifying that the pronoun "it" in
              this question refers to "Reaver FY13."

              When asked a comparison question, Quill was able to filter to
              headsets with prices above a threshold.

            <p>
              Finally, Quill determined the intent of this question to be a
              comparison between two time periods, and is able to provide a
              summary that includes the absolute difference, percent difference,
              and revenue amount from each year.

              Narrative Science patented the technology, which is now owned by
              Salesforce, and Slack! The incredible team I worked with: Clayton
              Norris, Mike Smathers, Nate Nichols, and Dan Platt. The project
              would not have been possible without the ideas of Andrew Paley and
              David Huang.
