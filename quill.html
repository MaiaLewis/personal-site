              With the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, natural language
              generation became a mainstream concept in ways I could never have
              imagined. The seemingly effortless writing produced by today’s
              large language models makes it easy to overlook the challenges we
              faced while building a more rule-based engine at Narrative
              Science. Yet, there's something enduringly relevant about the
              transparency of the system we designed in 2016. Unlike large
              statistical models, our platform wasn’t a black box—every output
              could be traced back to a known ontological concept or a testable
              analytic within our framework. This is the story of that platform:
              Quill.
            </p>
            <h2 class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">The business</h2>
            <p>
              <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfC3rNmQXw8"
                class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"
                target="blank"
                >Narrative Science</a
              >
              was founded in 2010 by two Northwestern University Computer
              Science professors and their business partners. A handful of
              graduate students had created a program that could generate short
              recap stories about little league baseball games, given data such
              as player names and scores.
            </p>
            <p>
              The business opportunity became clear—every day we generate more
              and more data that requires manpower to be analyzed and shared in
              a meaningful way. The game summarizer served as a prototype for
              the company’s first platform, Quill, which could be configured to
              construct sentences and paragraphs based on structured data.
            </p>
            <p>
              In November 2021, Narrative Science was acquired by Salesforce and
              integrated into their sprawling teams and resources. However, when
              I joined in early 2015, the company was about 70 people strong and
              growing quickly. The majority of business came from financial
              institutions wanting to automate their portfolio commentary. In a
              traditional set up, financial advisors spend a significant amount
              of time writing summaries of each client’s portfolio performance,
              to be shared alongside graphs and charts on a quarterly basis. The
              writing required is straightforward, based entirely on data, and
              very routine. With Quill, they could generate summaries in seconds
              that were accurate and indistinguishable from the human-crafted
              alternative.
            </p>
            <h2 class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">The premise of the new platform</h2>
            <p>
              I was hired to support the engineering team as they embarked on
              creating the third version of the software. Quill, like many early
              platforms, was designed almost entirely by engineers. While it
              supported an impressive spread of clients and their use cases, it
              was extremely complicated to configure and required an internal
              professional services team to run and maintain each project.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal of the ambitious redesign was twofold: one, to make the
              platform self-service with a simple and intuitive user experience,
              and two, to transform the underlying representation from a rules
              engine of text snippets and data transformations into an
              intelligent combination of three separate things: the language
              knowledge specific to a domain, the author’s communication goals
              arranged into an outline, and the data requirements that would map
              it to the source file or database.
            </p>
            <h2 class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">The early user interface</h2>
            <p>
              The reimagined Quill user experience had four primary screens
              within the context of a project: the outline, the ontology, the
              data requirements, and the live story.
            </p>
            <img src="images/projects/quill2.svg" class="my-4" />
            <p>
              Within the outline, the project author would arrange communication
              goals. The goals were generalized, analytical statements, such as
              “Present the attribute of an entity,” and “Compare the attribute
              of entity 1 to entity 2.” The author would then configure these
              goals with the specifics of the story—pulling language from the
              project ontology—into statements like “Present the grade of the
              student in 2015.”
            </p>
            <img src="images/projects/quill3.svg" class="my-4" />
            <p>
              The ontology stored the language settings specific to the project.
              The author could create entities, such as a “student” and “class”,
              relationships, such as “is enrolled in,” and attributes like
              “name” and “ID”. These language settings included multiple
              expressions, for example “high schooler” might be an alternative
              to “student.” The ontology could be saved and shared to other
              projects. We aspired to have language models for any imaginable
              domain that an author could pull into their project from a global
              knowledge base.
            </p>
            <img src="images/projects/quill4.svg" class="my-4" />
            <p>
              Within the data requirements, the author would map the entities
              and attributes referenced in their outline to fields from a data
              source. So for example, the names of students might be found in a
              field called “full_name” from a table called “student_info”, while
              their grade might be pulled from the field “final” in a table
              called “BIO201_2015”.
            </p>
            <img src="images/projects/quill5.svg" class="my-4" />
            <p>
              Finally, the live story page would show the generated story. The
              author could preview different versions by flipping the data
              source or a high level filter. They also had the ability to edit
              expressions, and resolve errors in line.
            </p>
            <p>
              At a high level, the user interface borrowed from other creative
              tools, where the body of the page reflected the state of the
              project, and configuration and settings were handled in a set of
              dynamic menus along the right. We designed many of these sidebars
              to be accessible from multiple screens, for example, the menu for
              editing an expression could be triggered from either the ontology
              or the live story. While there were many screens to navigate, most
              new users quickly understood the concept of the outline, how it
              influenced the data requirements, and what to expect from the live
              story page. The UI was successful in many ways, and for a
              first-of-its-kind tool, had a relatively shallow learning curve.
            </p>
            <h2 class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">Three years of learning</h2>
            <p>
              I learned more each day that I worked at Narrative Science than
              during any other period in my career. What I learned at Narrative
              Science could fill a library, but I have condensed the major
              takeaways into the following three themes.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, no matter how revolutionary the technology is, a product
              must be designed for real people with a real use case. Our
              reluctance to narrow our focus to a target customer and define our
              product against their needs and motivations made it exceedingly
              challenging to agree on our priorities. This eventually led to a
              fairly dramatic product and leadership pivot.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, when designing new technology, it’s incredibly important
              for teams to focus their creative energy on the unsolved problems.
              Many of the experiences we designed in Quill had existing
              solutions, and the time we spent reinventing them was time we
              didn’t spend focusing on the problems that were truly unique to
              our product.
            </p>
            <p>
              And finally, great teamwork has magical properties—five people
              with the right match of skills and team dynamics can accomplish
              what 50 people can in the same amount of time. I am so thankful
              for the exceptional people I had the opportunity to collaborate
              with on Quill, but especially the other two members of the Design
              trio,
