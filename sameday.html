              > is known for free 2-day shipping across a network of
              100+ online stores. In 2019, we began exploring how we might take
              our membership to the next level by offering free same-day
              delivery. One year later, we launched with two alpha partners—Saks
              Fifth Avenue and American Eagle Outfitters. Same-day delivery is
              free for ShopRunner members and now available in over 50 cities
              nation-wide.

              This video is pulled from two separate presentations I gave during
              company all hands meetings in 2019 and 2020. Hopefully it gives a
              good overview of the product from concept to launch.

            <h2 class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">Discovery Research</h2>
            <p>
              While the demo above takes the shopper’s point of view, in fact,
              our research and design work focused primarily on the needs of our
              brand partners. We conducted several rounds of discovery research
              in order to understand how retailers think about same-day delivery
              and where it might fit into their larger fulfillment systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user interviews included representatives across digital
              marketing, supply chain, and store operations, covering questions
              like “How has the pandemic impacted your in-store pickup and
              delivery options?” and “Have you ever discussed launching a
              same-day delivery program?”. We then used the second half of our
              interviews to gather feedback on different feature ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our discovery research influenced the product strategy in several
              major ways:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-8 space-y-2">
              <li>
                We prioritized making our internal delivery tracking portal
                available for our partners’ customer service teams.
              </li>
              <li>
                With a new appreciation for the brand sensitivity of our
                partners, we created a white-label version of our post-purchase
                communication.
              </li>
              <li>
                In response to the increased ecommerce demand and subsequent
                shipping carrier capacity limits caused by COVID-19, we expanded
                how we sell our capabilities to include local and next-day.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">Visualizing the product</h2>
            <p>
              The majority of our same-day offering is somewhat invisible. The
              brand’s website reaches out to our APIs to check location and
              product eligibility, and their in-store software similarly sends a
              request when the package is ready for courier pickup. From a
              customer experience perspective, ShopRunner only controls the
              post-purchase communication, which can be customized to fit the
              brand’s look and feel.
            </p>
            <p>
              For all of these reasons, our typical sales slides were failing to
              communicate what exactly the product was. To help the sales team,
              we created this interactive overview in Figma.
